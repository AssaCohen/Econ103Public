  \question Suppose $X \sim \mbox{Uniform}(0,1)$ and let $A$ be the \emph{area} of a circle with radius equal to $X$. 
   Recall that the area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\pi r^2$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part[5] Calculate $E[X]$.  
    \begin{solution}[2in]
        $E[X] = \int_{0}^{1} x \; dx = \left. (x^2/2) \right|_0^1 =  1/2$
      \end{solution}
    \part[5] Calculate $E[A]$.
    \begin{solution}[2in]
      $E[A] = E[\pi X^2] = \pi E[X^2] = \pi\int_{0}^{1} x^2  \; dx = \pi/3$
    \end{solution}
    \part[5] Suppose I constructed a circle with radius equal to $E[X]$. 
    Would its area equal $E[A]$? Why or why not? Explain briefly.
    \begin{solution}[2in]
      No: in general the expected value of a function is not equal to the function of the expected value.
      Here, $E[\pi X^2]\neq \pi E[X]^2$ -- the first of these equals $\pi/3$ while the second equals $\pi/4$.
    \end{solution}
    \part[5] Calculate $Var(A)$. You may leave your answer in terms of $\pi$. 
    \begin{solution}[2.75in]
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        Var(A) &=&  E[A^2] - E[A]^2 = E\left[ \pi^2 X^4 \right] - \left( \pi/3 \right)^2 \\
        &=& \pi^2 \int_0^1 x^4 \; dx - \pi^2/9 \\
      &=& \pi^2 \cdot \left. \frac{x^5}{5} \right|_0^1 - \pi^2/9 = \pi^2\left( 1/5 - 1/9 \right) = 4\pi^2/45
      \end{eqnarray*}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

  \question Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables with covariance $\sigma_{XY}$ and variances $\sigma_{X}^2$ and $\sigma_{Y}^2$ where $E[X]=E[Y]=0$.
  Define $\beta = \sigma_{XY}/\sigma_{X}^2$ and $Z = Y - \beta X$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part[4] Is $\beta$ a random variable or a constant? Explain briefly.
    \begin{solution}[1.25in]
      A constant: it's a function parameters, which are constants.
    \end{solution}
    \part[4] Is $Z$ a random variable or a constant? Explain briefly.
    \begin{solution}[1.25in]
      A random variable: it's a function of the RVs $Y$ and $X$.
    \end{solution}
    \part[5] Calculate $E[Z]$.
    \begin{solution}[1.75in]
      $E[Z] = E[Y - \beta X] = E[Y] - \beta E[X] = 0$
    \end{solution}
    \part[12] Calculate $Cov(X,Z)$.
    \begin{solution}[2.75in]
      Since both $X$ and $Z$ have zero mean,
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        Cov(X,Z) &=& E[XZ] = E\left[ X\left( Y - \beta X \right) \right]\\
        &=& E[XY] - \beta E[X^2] = Cov(X,Y) - \beta Var(X) \\
        &=& \sigma_{XY} - \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_{X}^2} \cdot \sigma_X^2 = 0
      \end{eqnarray*}
      using the fact that $E[X]=E[Y]=0$ and the definition of $\beta$.
    \end{solution}
    %\part[12] Which is larger: $Var(Z)$ or $Var(Y)$? Prove your answer.
    %\begin{solution}
      %\begin{eqnarray*}
        %Var(Z) &=& E[Z^2] = E\left[ (Y - \beta X)^2 \right]\\
      %&=& E\left[ Y^2 \right] - 2\beta E\left[ XY \right] + \beta^2 E[X^2]\\
      %&=&  \sigma_{Y}^2- 2 \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X^2} \cdot \sigma_{XY} + \left( \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma^2_X} \right)^2 \sigma_X^2\\
        %&=& \sigma_{Y}^2- 2 \frac{\sigma_{XY}^2}{\sigma_X^2} +  \frac{\sigma_{XY}^2}{\sigma^2_X}  \\
        %&=& \sigma_Y^2 - \frac{\sigma_{XY}^2}{\sigma_X^2}
      %\end{eqnarray*}
      %The covariance $\sigma_{XY}$ can be positive, negative, or zero. 
      %the \emph{squared covariance} $\sigma_{XY}^2$, however, can only be positive or zero. 
      %Since $\sigma^2_X > 0$ we see that $Var(Z) \leq Var(Y)$ with equality if and only if $\sigma_{XY}=0$. 
    %\end{solution}
  \end{parts}


  \question Mallesh wants to know the proportion $p$ of Penn undergraduates who smoke cigarettes, so he interviews a random sample of $n$ students.
  Let $X_i$ be a random variable that indicates whether the $i^{th}$ person in the sample is \emph{truly} a smoker: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
  Because of social stigma, conditional on being a smoker, person $i$ will \emph{lie} and claim to be a non-smoker with probability $q$ when interviewed.
  Conditional on being a non-smoker, person $i$ always tells the truth when interviewed.
  Let $Y_i$ be a random variable that indicates whether the $i^{th}$ person in the sample \emph{claims} to be a smoker: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
  \begin{parts}
    \part[12] For a single individual $i$, write the joint distribution of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ in tabular form, arranging $X_i$ in the \emph{rows} and $Y_i$ in the \emph{columns} of your table.
    Your answer should be expressed in terms of $p$ and $q$.
    \begin{solution}[3.25in]
        We construct the table of joint probabilities using the conditional pmf of $Y_i$ given $X_i$. 
        We have:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
          P(X_i=0, Y_i=0) &=&  P(Y_i=0|X_i=0)P(X_i=0) = 1-p\\
          P\left( X_i=0, Y_i=1 \right) &=&  P\left( Y_i = 1 | X_{i} =0 \right)P(X_i=0) = 0\\
          P\left( X_i = 1, Y_i = 0 \right) &=& P(Y_i = 0|X_i = 1)P(X_i=1) =  qp \\
          P\left( X_i = 1, Y_i = 1 \right) &=& P(Y_i = 1|X_i = 1)P(X_i=1) = (1-q)p 
        \end{eqnarray*}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{|cc|cc|}
				\hline
				&&\multicolumn{2}{c|}{$Y_i$}\\
				&& 0 & 1\\
				\hline
				\multirow{2}{*}{$X_i$}
				&0& $1-p$ & 0\\
				&1& $qp$& $(1-q)p$\\
				\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
    \end{solution}
    \part[4] Using your answer to the preceding, calculate the marginal pmf of $Y_i$.
    \begin{solution}[1.75in]
      Summing over the entries in each \emph{column} of the table, we have, $P(Y_i = 0) = [1- (p - qp)]$ and $P(Y_i = 1) = (p - qp)$.
    \end{solution}
    \part[6] Using your answers to the preceding two parts, calculate $Cov(X_i, Y_i)$.
    \begin{solution}[2.75in]
    We proceed using the shortcut formula.
    First, since $E[X_i] = p$ and $E[Y_i]=(p-qp)$, $E[X_i]E[Y_i] = p^2(1-q)$.
    To calculate $E[X^2]$, we only need to look at the lower right entry in the joint pmf table: all other terms in the sum are zero.
    Thus: $Cov(X_i, Y_i) = p(1-q) - p^2(1-q)= p(1-p)(1-q)$.
    \end{solution}
    \part[8] Since some students may be lying to him, Mallesh does \emph{not} observe $X_1, \hdots, X_n$.
    He only observes $Y_1, \hdots, Y_n$.
    If Mallesh uses the sample mean of $Y_1, \hdots, Y_n$ to estimate $p$, will this procedure be unbiased?
    If so, prove it.
    If not, will this procedure produce an overestimate or an underestimate?
    Why?
    \begin{solution}[2.75in]
      $E\left[ \left( Y_1 + \cdots + Y_n \right)/n \right] = E\left[ Y_i \right]= p - qp$. 
      Since the expected value of this estimator is not $p$, Mallesh's procedure is biased. 
      In particular, the bias is: $p - (p - qp) = -qp$. 
      Unless $q=0$, Mallesh will tend to \emph{underestimate} the true fraction of smokers.
      This is because some smokers lie and say that they are non-smokers, but no non-smokers lie and say they are smokers.
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}



  \question Suppose we have a dataframe called \texttt{StudentData} with two columns: \texttt{height} and \texttt{handspan}.
  Each row in the dataset corresponds to a student who took Econ 103 at Penn over the past three years: \texttt{height} gives her height in inches while \texttt{handspan} gives her handspan in centimeters.
  In the spirit of the sampling experiment I discussed in class, which you replicated on Problem Set \#7, suppose we want to examine the sampling distribution of the \emph{sample covariance} between height and handspan using a Monte Carlo simulation in which we treat \texttt{StudentData} as a \emph{population} from which we repeatedly draw random samples.
  \begin{parts}
    \part[10] Write an R function called \texttt{cov.sim} that takes a random sample of \texttt{n} \emph{rows} of \texttt{StudentData} and returns the sample correlation between \texttt{height} and \texttt{handspan} based on the sampled rows.
    Your function should take a single input argument: \texttt{n}.
    You may assume that there are no missing values.
    \begin{solution}[3in]
\begin{verbatim}
cov.sim <- function(n){
  sim.rows <- sample(1:nrow(StudentData), n, replace = TRUE)
  sim.data <- StudentData[sim.rows,]
  return(cov(sim.data$height, sim.data$handspan))
}
\end{verbatim}
  \end{solution}
  \part[5] Using your function from the previous part, write R code to plot a histogram of the sampling distribution of the sample covariance with a sample size of 20, based on 1000 simulation replications.
  \begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{verbatim}
sims <- replicate(1000, cov.sim(20))
hist(sims)
\end{verbatim}
  \end{solution}
  \end{parts}
