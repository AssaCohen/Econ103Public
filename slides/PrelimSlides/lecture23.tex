\begin{block}{Statistical Significance}
Suppose we carry out a hypothesis test at the $\alpha\%$ level and,  based on our data, reject the null. You will often see this situation described as ``statistical significance.''
\end{block}

\begin{block}{In Other Words...}
When people say ``statistically significant'' what they really mean is that they rejected the null hypothesis.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Some Examples}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item We found a difference between the ``Hi'' and ``Lo'' groups in the anchoring experiment that was statistically significant at the 5\% level based on data from a past semester.
		\item Our 95\% CI for the proportion of US voters who know who John Roberts is did not include 0.5. Viewed as a two-sided test, we found that the difference between the true population proportion and 0.5 was statistically significant at the 5\% level.

\frametitle{Why Did I Avoid this Terminology?}
\small
\begin{block}{Statistical Significance $\neq$ Practical Importance}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You need to understand the term ``statistically significant'' since it is widely used. A better term for the idea, however, would be ``statistically discernible''
		\item Unfortunately, many people are confuse ``significance'' in the narrow, technical sense with the everyday English word meaning ``important'' 
		\item \alert{Statistically Significant Does Not Mean Important!"}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A difference can be practically unimportant but statistically significant.
				\item A difference can be practically important but statistically insignificant.

\begin{quote}
Just before I started writing this book, a study was published reporting about a 10\% lower rate of breast cancer in women who were advised to eat less fat. If this indeed the true difference, low fat diets could reduce the incidence of breast cancer by tens of thousands of women each year -- astonishing health benefit for something as simple and inexpensive as cutting down on fatty foods. The p-value for the difference in cancer rates was 0.07 and here is the key point: this was widely misinterpreted as indicating that low fat diets don't work. For example, the \emph{New York Times} editorial page trumpeted that ``low fat diets flub a test'' and claimed that the study provided ``strong evidence that the war against all fats was mostly in vain.'' \alert{However failure to prove that a treatment is effective is not the same as proving it ineffective.}

			\item E.g.\ there's no difference in grades between students with different 4th digits of their student id number.

	\item Academic journals tend only to publish results in which a null hypothesis is rejected at the 5\% level or lower. 
	\item We end up with the bizarre result that ``most published studies are false.''

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Failing to reject $H_0$ does not mean $H_0$ is true. 
		\item Rejecting $H_0$ does not mean $H_1$ is true.
		\item P-values are always more informative than simply reporting ``Reject'' vs.\ ``Fail To Reject'' at a given significance level. 
		\item Confidence intervals are more informative that hypothesis tests, since they give an idea of the size of an effect. 
		\item If $H_0$ is actually plausible a priori (this is rarer than you may think), reporting a p-value can be a good complement to a CI. 
		\item To avoid data-dredging be honest about the tests you have carried out: report \emph{all of them}, not just the ones where you rejected the null.
