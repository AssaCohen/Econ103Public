  A deterministic (i.e.\ non-random) function that assigns a numeric value to each basic outcome of a random experimnet.
\end{block}
 
\begin{block}{Realization: $x$}
A particular numeric value that an RV could take on. We write $\{X = x\}$ to refer to the \emph{event} that the RV $X$ took on the value $x$.  
\end{block}
 
\begin{block}{Support Set (aka Support)}
The set of all possible realizations of a RV.

\begin{block}{Notation}
Capital latin letters for RVs, e.g.\ $X,Y,Z$, and the corresponsing lowercase letters for their realizations, e.g.\ $x,y,z$.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Intuition}
  You can think of an RV as a machine that spits out random numbers: although the machine is deterministic, its inputs, the outcomes of a random experiment, are not.

\frametitle{Important Note about Support Sets}
Whenever you write down the pmf of a RV, it is \alert{crucial} to also write down its Support Set. Recall that this is the set of \alert{\emph{all possible realizations for a RV}}. Outside of the support set, all probabilities are zero. In other words, the pmf is \alert{only defined} on the support.

\frametitle{Properties of Probability Mass Functions}

If $p(x)$ is the pmf of a random variable $X$, then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item $0\leq p(x) \leq 1$ for all $x$ \vspace{1em}
	\item $\displaystyle \sum_{\mbox{all } x} p(x) = 1$

The threshold $x_0$ is allowed to be \emph{any real number}. In particular, it doesn't have to be in the support of $X$!

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why Random Variables?}
  Use as a model for population. No longer talk about population size $N$, because this turns out to be irrelevant. Explain why with a simple example. This slide should probably come after I actually introduce Bernoulli RV, etc. Treat population relative frequencies as probabilities rather than counts divided by $N$. Defined probability as long-run relative frequency and here we would think of repeatedly sampling from the population. Also we never know $N$ in practice. Emphasize that from the perspective of sampling, $N$ is irrelevant. Give a simple urn example. Try to distinguish continuous and discrete. Then again, maybe it's still too early for them to digest this.
