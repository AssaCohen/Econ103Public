\begin{block}{Bag Contains 100 Candies}
Estimate total weight of candies by weighing a random sample of size 5 and multiplying the result by 20.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Your Chance to Win}
The bag of candies and a digital scale will make their way around the room \alert{during the lecture}. Each team (2 students) gets a chance to draw 5 candies and weigh them.
\end{block}
\begin{alertblock}{Team with closest estimate wins the bag of candy!}

\frametitle{Weighing a Random Sample}
\begin{block}{Procedure}
When the bag and scale reach your team, do the following:
\end{block}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold the top of the bag over and shake to randomize.
\item Randomly draw 5 candies \alert{without replacement}.
\item Weigh your sample and record the result \alert{in grams}.
\item Rodrigo will enter your result into his spreadsheet and multiply it by 20 to estimate the weight of the bag.
\item Replace your sample and shake again to re-randomize.
\item Pass bag and scale to next team.
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Recall: (Simple) Random Sample}

\begin{block}{Definition in Words}
Select a sample of $n$ objects from a population in such a way that:
	\begin{enumerate}
\item Each member of the population has the same probability of being selected 
\item The fact that one individual is selected does not affect the chance that any other individual is selected
\item Each sample of size $n$ is equally likely to be selected

\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{Definition in Math}
	$X_1, X_2, \hdots, X_n \sim \mbox{iid } f(x)$ if continuous\\
  $X_1, X_2, \hdots, X_n \sim \mbox{iid } p(x)$ if discrete

  \frametitle{Random Sample Means \emph{Sample With Replacement}}


\begin{itemize}
  \item Without replacement $\Rightarrow$ dependence between samples
  \item But sample small relative to popn.\ $\Rightarrow$ dependence negligible.
  \item This means our candy experiment (in progress) isn't bogus.

    Draw with replacement $\implies$ only the sample size and the \emph{proportion} of Hillary supporters in the population matter.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{(Sample) Statistic}

  Any function of the data \emph{alone}, e.g.\ sample mean $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. Typically used to estimate an unknown population parameter: e.g.\ $\bar{x}$ is an estimate of $\mu$.

  Suppose that exactly half of voters in the population support Hillary Clinton and we poll a random sample of 4 voters. If we code Hillary supporters as ``1'' and everyone else as ``0'' then what are the possible values of the sample mean in our dataset?

    \item $(0,1)$

  \frametitle{Sampling Distribution}
  Under random sampling, a sample stat.\ is a RV. Thus it has PDF if continuous of PMF if discrete: this is called its \emph{sampling distribution}.

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   p(0) &=&  0.0625\\
   p(0.25) &=&  0.25\\

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Some New Terminology}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Under random sampling, a statistic is a RV
    \item In any real example, however, our dataset is \emph{fixed} so a sample statistic is just a \emph{constant number}
    \item We need some more precise terminology to make this distinction precise: \alert{Estimator} vs.\ \alert{Estimate}
    \item Use these terms instead of statistic from now on\dots \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Estimator versus Estimate}

\begin{block}{Estimator}
  A function $T(X_1, \hdots, X_n)$ of the RVs that represent the \emph{procedure} of drawing a random sample, hence a RV itself.
\end{block}
\pause
\begin{block}{Sampling Distribution}
The probability distribution (PMF of PDF) of an Estimator. 
\end{block}
\pause
\begin{block}{Estimate}
A function $T(x_1, \hdots, x_n)$ of the \emph{observed data}, i.e.\ the \emph{realizations} of the random variables we use to represent random sampling. 
Since its a function of constants, an estimate is itself a constant.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Procedure versus Result of the Procedure}
\begin{block}{Procedure = Random Variable}
\begin{itemize}
\item $X_1, \hdots, X_n$ represents \alert{procedure of taking a random sample}. 
\item $\bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ represents \alert{procedure of taking sample mean}  
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\pause
\begin{block}{Sampling Dist.\ = Probabilistic Behavior of Procedure}
If I repeat the procedure of taking the mean of a random sample over and over for many samples, what relative frequencies do I get \alert{for the sample means?}
\end{block}

\pause
\begin{block}{Result of Procedure = Constant}
 \begin{itemize}
\item $x_1, \hdots, x_n$ is the  \alert{result of sampling}, the observed data. 
\item $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ is the \alert{result of taking sample mean}

Why would I advise you not to play the lottery?
\pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You may sometimes win, but if you play the lottery many times, on average you will lose money. \pause
		\item Let $X$ be a random variable representing lottery winnings. I am arguing that $E[X]$ - Cost of Ticket $< 0$
	\end{itemize}
\pause
\begin{block}{Procedure = Random Variable}
Making a habit of playing the lottery. Expectation is negative.
\end{block}
